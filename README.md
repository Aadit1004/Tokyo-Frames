### About the Game

This project was my first completed game in Unreal Engine 5, set in a stylized Tokyo 
environment centered around photography. Through this project, I delved into 
Unreal's Blueprint system, enhancing my skills in gameplay mechanics and UI programming. 
I learned techniques for player control and dynamic camera manipulation, developed custom 
input mappings for events, designed audio, and created responsive menus, including a fully 
functional graphics options menu.
